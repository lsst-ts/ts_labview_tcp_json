# LabVIEW Component Simulator

The Component Simulator allows you to call the LabVIEW TCP Server to test the TCP communication between the TCP Server and the TCP Client.
The LabVIEW TCP Server receives json commands from the Python TCP Client, and send ack and events back to the client, using TCP packets.

## Configuration File

The configuration file is in the `config/` directory.
The following is the detail:

1. [default.ini](../doc/detailsDefault.md): This file stores the **id** of commands, **id** and **compName** of events, and **id** and **compName** of telemetry.
LabVIEW Component will read this file to register commands, events and telemetry in TCP Server.

### Start Component Simulator

From terminal:

Go to the `build/` directory:

```sh
cd  ts_labview_tcp_json/build
```

Execute Component Simulator:

```sh
./ComponentSimulator
```

From LabVIEW project:

Go to the `simulator/` directory, find `ComponentSimulator.vi`, press right click on it and select **Run**.

Check:

- cmdServerPort = 8888
- telServerPort = 8889
- serverTimeout (ms) = 100
- serverBytesToRead = 32768

Note: this configuration cannot be modified in runtime.

### Available Commands

As User you will have the possibility to tell TCP Server which commands are allowed, through the use of the `default.ini` file.
You can click [here](../config/default.ini) to check which commands will be allowed.
If you send any of them, you will get the `ack` message in TCP Client.
If you send a different command, you will get the `noack` in TCP Client.

NOTE:

1. If you change any of them in the `default.ini` file, you will have to restart the Component Simulator.

### Send Command Status to TCP Client

If you want to send the Command Status to the TCP Client, do:

- Go to tab "Set Ack Cmd Status".
- Click "Success" to inform the TCP Client the command was executed successfully.
- Click "Fail" to inform the TCP Client the command was executed with fails.
- Read the Command Status in TCP Client.

### Send Events to TCP Client

If you want to send Events to TCP Client, do:

- Go to tab "Send Event".
- Write a name in Event Id control.
- Write details in Event Details control.
- Click "Send Event" to send the event.
- Read the event in TCP Client.

The structure of this Event is, for instance:

| Event Id |    Event Details    |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|
|   move   | "InPosition" : true |
|          | "Tolerance" : 0.2   |

You can send another Event Id with other Event Details.

Note:

1. If you want to send a boolean in Event Details, please use non capital letters, for instance `true` or `false`.

### Receive Events from TCP Client

TCP Server will receive Events that LabVIEW component subscribed through the [default.ini](../config/default.ini) file.

### Stop Component Simulator

To stop the Component Simulator click to "Stop Simulator" button.

Note:

1. You can only stop the Simulator Component if you stop de TCP Server before.
2. If you want to stop the TCP Client while the TCP Server is running, the Server will wait for a new TCP Client connection.
